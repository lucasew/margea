# Guidelines

- Always install jdx/mise before touching anything in code. Make sure intermediary files are gitignored or ausent.
- Don't ever inline icons
- Don't touch the headers
- Don't format code that you are not creating
- Prefer using well known solutions for validation instead of trying to implement your own
- If you are a open scope housekeeping agent start with deviations from these guidelines before looking for anything else
